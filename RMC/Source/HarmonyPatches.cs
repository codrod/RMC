/*
 * Bugs:
 * 1) The pawn generator class only takes Factions not FactionDefs. Which causes a problem if you try to mix armies
 * because if a custom faction def is used it wont exist. So the default faction will be used instead.
 * 
 * 2) Generated back stories may contradict the forced (disallowed) traits/work tags if both back stories are not forced?
 * In general mixing forced back stories with random causes problems. It is better to just force both childhood and adulthood
 * instead of just one.
 * 
 * 3) ISC should not have relatives! I noticed that royal tribute collector had a guard with a relation to one of the spacemarines
 * Should see if there is a solution that problem but there might not be.
